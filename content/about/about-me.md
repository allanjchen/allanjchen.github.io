## Hey There!

I'm **Allan**, an aspiring engineer with experience working on rocket propulsion systems, basic robotics, and various small engineering projects. I'm currently a 4th year undergraduate studying Aerospace Engineering at **UCLA**. I built this website to showcase the projects i've worked on.

I've always been fascinated by the inner workings of machines. 
In middle school, I started fixing and flipping bicycles. 
In high school, I bought my first car, a 1997 Honda Civic, with money from my first job. 
I did maintenance, repairs, and modifications with friends on weekends. 
Now, as an engineering student in university, I continue to work on exciting projects you can learn about on this site!
