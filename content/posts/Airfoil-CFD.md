As part of UCLA's MAE150B Aerodynamics course, students completed a final project focused on analyzing the aerodynamic characteristics of various geometries using COMSOL Multiphysics' Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) module. The objective was to investigate how shape and flow conditions influence key performance metrics such as the lift coefficient (C<sub>L</sub>) and drag coefficient (C<sub>D</sub>).

Students analyzed a set of provided geometries—including a non-lifting cylinder, a symmetric NACA 0010 airfoil, a cambered NACA 4410 airfoil, and a finite wing based on the NACA 4410 profile—using steady, incompressible CFD simulations in COMSOL. The process involved mesh refinement, selection of appropriate boundary conditions, solver configuration, and post-processing to extract aerodynamic force coefficients.
