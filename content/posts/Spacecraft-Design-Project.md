During UCLA’s MAE161C – Spacecraft Design course, our team was challenged with developing a conceptual sample return mission to Saturn’s moon Enceladus. Working in a group of 8–10 students, we divided responsibilities across high-level mission planning and subsystem design to produce a comprehensive first-pass spacecraft concept that met specified mission requirements.

As the structures engineer, I was responsible for designing the spacecraft’s primary structural framework, developing a detailed CAD model, and performing preliminary structural analysis to ensure the vehicle could withstand anticipated launch loads.
